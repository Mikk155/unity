<h2>Implement Appearance Flags</h2>
<br><br>
These are KeyValues supported on all entities that will deny the DispatchSpawn function if appearflag is matched
<br><br>
Appearance flags keys has 3 possible values
<br><br>
<li>-1 "Not in" Meaning this entity won't spawn if matched the condition</li>
<br><br>
<li>1 "Only in" Meaning this entity will spawn only if matched the condition</li>
<br><br>
<li>0 "Default" Has no effect at all</li>
<br><br>
i.e a entity with ``appearflag_singleplayer`` > -1 will only appear if this is not a single player match
<br><br>
on the other side a entity with ``appearflag_singleplayer`` > 1 will only appear in a single player match
<br><br>

<br><br>
Prevent player killing upon spawning on an occupied spawnpoint, instead relocate the newest player in a valid hull around the spawnpoint, if none found then kill the standing player as it were before.

<h2>Implement back and side long jumping inspired by Black Mesa</h2>
<li>longjump_falldamage</li>

<br>
1 always take fall damage
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<li>longjump_sound</li>
0 do not any noise
<br>
1 do player/pl_long_jump.wav
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Implement new entity logic_usevalue.</h2>
Will fire it's target/netname whatever the flValue it received on trigger is the same as the specified.
<br>
This entity will make more sense and will be used on advanced logics in a future.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Implement Appearance Flags</h2>
These are KeyValues supported on all entities that will deny the DispatchSpawn function if appearflag is matched
<br>
Appearance flags keys has 3 possible values
<br>
<br>
<li>-1 "Not in" Meaning this entity won't spawn if matched the condition</li>
<br>
<li>1 "Only in" Meaning this entity will spawn only if matched the condition</li>
<br>
<li>0 "Default" Has no effect at all</li>
<br>
i.e a entity with ``appearflag_singleplayer`` > -1 will only appear if this is not a single player match
<br>
on the other side a entity with ``appearflag_singleplayer`` > 1 will only appear in a single player match
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Prevent player killing upon spawning on an occupied spawnpoint, instead relocate the newest player in a valid hull around the spawnpoint, if none found then kill the standing player as it were before.
